### Nampower settings
See https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower or in game tooltip for description of each setting.
Access settings in game by right clicking the minimap icon.

#### Queued spell icon display
If you have superwow there is an option (default off) to display an icon for the most recently queued spell (the mini fireball in the castbar).  You can resize and position it anywhere.
